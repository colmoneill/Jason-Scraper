ArtLogic Online is an Art Gallery Management System. They provide an API which is detailed
on <http://feeds.artlogic.net/>.

This application can synch a remote Artlogic API feed into a local MongoDB database.

From this database one can, for example, generate a public website for the Gallery.

The first iteration of this tool has been created for Gallerie Rodolphe Janssen, Brussels.
